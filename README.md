-Create a program that measures the speed of a car
-If the speed limit is less than 70,it should print "OK"
-For every 5km/s above the speed limit (70,) it should give the driver one demerit and print the total number of denmerit points
-If the driver gets more than 12 points the function should print:"License suspended"


## Solution: 
The driver gets license by having a speed limit that does not exceed 70
